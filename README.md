# Guidr Backend - API & Database

[Product Canvas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ns6BMdMOIOjfxtsIzGvBAaxU45Qd_V9YpT-w1JoLRIc/edit?usp=sharing)

Base URL: `https://guidr-backend-api.herokuapp.com/api`

Checking this in a browser or making a `GET` request to it directly should return a `JSON` object like this:  
```
{
    status: "It's Alive!"
}
```

## Authentication  

All endpoints except for `Login` and `Register` will require Authentication by the client. Any client (web or mobile) will need to authenticate their requests by placing a token as the value for the `Authorization` header.
A `token` property is returned in the response on both the `Login` and `Register` requests and does not expire for 7 days.

The token for a user can only be used to performs actions for that user specifically. Requests made to trips or profile owned by a user from a token generated by a different user will receive the `401` status code. In the response will be an object with an `error` property.

Profile  
```
{ error: 'Access to this user data is unauthorized' }
```  
Trips  
```
{ error: 'Access to this trip data is unauthorized' }
```

## Errors  

When errors occur with the requests a json object will be returned with an `error` property containing information on what error occurred.  
```
{
  error: <ERROR_STRING_TEXT>
}
```
